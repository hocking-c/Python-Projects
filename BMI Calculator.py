# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
#
# NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number
# and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.
#
# Example Input 1
# 1.75
# 80
# means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75
#
# Example Output 1
# 26
# Since: 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input("Enter your height in meters.")
print(height)
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input("Enter your weight in kilograms.")
print(weight)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
new_height = float(height)
new_weight = int(weight)
bmi = new_weight/(new_height*new_height)
clean_bmi = round(bmi, 2)
print(f"Your bmi is {clean_bmi}.")

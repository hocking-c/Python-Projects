# Instructions
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us
# how many weeks we have left;if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and
# output a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x weeks left.
# Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.
#
# Example Input
# 56
# Example Output
# You have 1768 weeks left.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
age = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
years_left = 90 - int(age)
time_weeks = years_left * 52
print(f"You have {time_weeks} weeks left.")
